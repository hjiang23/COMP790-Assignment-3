# COMP790 Assignment 3

A stick figure with spinning arms and legs and a house are moving and bouncing around a canvas. 
The animation stops when the chest of the stick figure touches the door of the house. 
The animation restarts with the stick figure and house in new, random locations on the canvas, when the user presses the spacebar.
The house is based on an example from MDN Web Docs: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D.
